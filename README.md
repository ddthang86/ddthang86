## 📔📓My Inspiration😀😀:

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/GitHub%20Inspiration%20Image.jpg"/>

My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence began when I was in my final year of a Bachelor of Technology program. I suggested to my teammates that we work on a machine learning project in __healthcare__, specifically using it to predict the chances of a person suffering from heart disease. We were able to download a dataset from [__Kaggle__](https://www.kaggle.com/) and implement machine learning models to make predictions. 

The results on the test set were promising, and this sparked my interest in finding more ways to apply machine learning. I have since taken courses in machine learning, including Andrew Ng's __Machine Learning__ and __Deep Learning Specialization__ and have worked on various data science projects in healthcare, academia, and the retail industry. Some of these projects involved data analysis and visualization to gain insights.

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/Key%20Learnings%20Image.jpg" width = "750"/>

During my machine learning journey, I had a good time learning important things and takeaways while implementing and executing various projects. As a result, I was able to learn iteratively and update my knowledge of the latest technologies and tools used in the process of building interesting AI-powered applications. Given below are some of the repositories that I have added that I felt had key ingredients in them that helped me excel in this data science journey. 

📽 [__Jose Portilla's Reinforcement Learning Course__](https://github.com/ddthang86/Jose-Portilla-Reinforcement-Learning) - One of the interesting things about the instructor [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/) is his attention to detail and clarity of explanation.

## 🔬🧐 My Thoughts on State-of-the-art (SOTA) Techniques in Artificial Intelligence

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/state%20of%20the%20art%20techniques%20image.gif" width = "750"/>

There is a large volume of research taking place in the field of machine learning and data science. There are newer and computationally efficient algorithms being developed by the likes of many companies and research institutes. I would like to share my thoughts on these latest machine learning trends and explain them well. 

&emsp;&emsp; 👀👁 [__Vision Transformers (ViTs)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer) - Transformers have revolutionized the __natural language processing industry (NLP)__ where a given text is converted into a representation that takes into account the contextual information for all the possible words given as input and returns a vector with these weights and other dependencies. One interesting research area that has emerged is to use of these same transformers for computer vision tasks. __Convolutional Neural Networks__, CNNs for short, are currently being used to take into account different positions of the image and map them with their weights before making predictions. But if we could represent these vectors by using contextual dependencies, then vision transformers might be able to replace CNNs in the future. Currently, as the performance of vision transformers has not been significantly higher than the CNN models, there is no replacement for CNNs. However, as the complexity of vision transformers increases, there is a possibility that they might replace CNNs for image processing tasks.

&emsp;&emsp; 📣🔊 [__LIME &__](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/blog/lime/) [__SHAP (Explainable AI)__](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html) - __LIME__ stands for __Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations__ while __SHAP__ stands for __Shapley Additive Explanations__. One of the challenges with using AI and machine learning, in general, is their lack of interpretability. Though there are models such as Random Forests and Decision trees that explain why they have come up with a particular outcome such as giving feature importance, they fail to account for local dependencies which means they do not give output for a particular query point but only provide explainability in terms of the entire dataset. Furthermore, there are other models that do not also offer these features. With the help of LIME and SHAP, it is possible to explain for a query point why a particular outcome is generated for any of the machine learning models at hand. Therefore, LIME and SHAP are good, and executing them is also a lot easier with the help of libraries.

&emsp;&emsp; 📕📚 [__BERT &__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) [__RoBERTa__](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/) - __BERT__ stands for __Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers__ while __RoBERTa__ stands for __Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach__. These models have been gaining popularity due to their extremely good performance in natural language processing tasks. They are basically transformers with bidirectional context vector representation. In other words, they take into account the context in terms of both the forward pass and the backward pass as well. This works extremely well due to the fact that representing each word based on the context of all the words in the document is basically a good way to understand human language. 

&emsp;&emsp; 🔎🔦 [__FAISS &__](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/faiss/) [__ScaNN__](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html) - When we are dealing with finding similar rows in our data and we have a very high dimensional representation of a vector, with traditional algorithms it takes a long time to find similarly if we use metrics such as __euclidean distance__ and __cosine similarity__. __Facebook Research__ has launched __FAISS__ that simplifies the process of searching for similarity and clustering of dense vectors. In the same light, __Google AI Research__ came up with __ScaNN__ which speeds up the overall process of computing the distance between various features and reduces the time complexity to a large extent. The outputs from these models contain vectors that represent a large amount of information from the input data. These are useful for building __good recommender systems__ where the items that are the most similar are recommended to a user along with many other applications as well.

&emsp;&emsp; 🎧🔉 [__Audio Signal as a Spectrogram__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram#:~:text=A%20spectrogram%20is%20a%20visual,may%20be%20called%20waterfall%20displays.) - We can define our audio signal in terms of a __spectrogram__ which is used in __audio processing__. One of the most insightful things that are currently done for deep learning is that an audio signal is converted to a spectrogram image which is later used with __convolutional neural networks (CNNs)__ for NLP tasks. Therefore, we are trying to pose the audio problem as a computer vision problem and get __higher accuracy__ and __better results__. __CNNs__ are known to perform especially well if we are able to give large amounts of image data. CNN along with transfer learning produces extremely good results. Therefore, it is improving the performance of NLP tasks such as __speech detection__ and many others. 

&emsp;&emsp; 🤝🕸  [__Siamese Networks__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) - Building __recommender systems__ whether it be __recommending items__, __movies__, or __songs__ with the help of deep neural networks can be a hard problem to define and solve respectively. With the help of __Siamese neural networks__, it is possible to use deep learning for recommending users various items as discussed above. __Siamese networks__ essentially take into account __2 different inputs__ and they have __2 networks__ that accept these inputs. The same weights are initialized to both networks and the __outputs__ from these two networks are combined together to get our predictions of how likely is the user going to like a particular item. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform __one-shot learning__ with these models which means that with few training examples, the model would learn to perform the best for the task at hand.

## 🔨⚒️ Data Science Key Challenges:

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/olav-ahrens-rotne-MAEbdaFe4ps-unsplash.jpg" width = "750"/>

Machine learning is used in many industries and there is a lot of demand and scope for it. There are so many tools and resources that one could be used in order to become a machine learning engineer. However, there are certain challenges in machine learning that must be addressed before they could be used for machine learning analysis. 

1. __Availability of data__ - Getting access to quality data is important for machine learning predictions. Sometimes, companies cannot have access to a large volume of data that could be used for machine learning purposes. Moreover, the data that is available might not give a very good prediction accuracy and might not be quite useful for the machine learning predictions at hand. 

2. __Infrastructure Requirements__ - There is also a possibility for the companies particularly startups to have the infrastructure needed for the machine learning processes respectively. They might be used some third-party applications such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order for them to perform their day-to-day predictions using ML algorithms. However, this would lead to further questions such as security and data ownership. 

3. __Rigid Business models__ - Companies need to be flexible where they must spend their time with other resources apart from the fixed number of resources for them to work effectively. There are many companies that might require deep learning models to be more flexible and more useful and robust. When we are implementing the machine learning models, there could be instances where we might have to fix our approach rather than be more flexible. This creates problems for large-scale businesses as they must adapt to the market as and when needed. Therefore, steps must be taken to make the models more flexible and easy to understand. 

4. __Lack of Talent__ - Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists are some of the talked about professions in the IT industry. There are many universities and colleges making use of artificial intelligence programs so that they could meet the demand from the tech industry. However, there still seem to be a lot of gaps in the industry. More and more courses and online learning resources should be created so that more people can enter the field of data science and machine learning.
