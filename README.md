## 📔📓My Inspiration😀😀:

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/GitHub%20Inspiration%20Image.jpg"/>

My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence began when I was in my final year of a Bachelor of Technology program. I suggested to my teammates that we work on a machine learning project in __healthcare__, specifically using it to predict the chances of a person suffering from heart disease. We were able to download a dataset from [__Kaggle__](https://www.kaggle.com/) and implement machine learning models to make predictions. 

The results of the test set were promising, and this sparked my interest in finding more ways to apply machine learning. I have since taken courses in machine learning, including Andrew Ng's __Machine Learning__ and __Deep Learning Specialization__, and have worked on various data science projects in healthcare, academia, and the retail industry. Some of these projects involved data analysis and visualization to gain insights.
