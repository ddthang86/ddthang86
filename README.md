<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I hold a Bachelor's & Masters's Degree in Data Science at [__Vietnam National University of Agricultural - Faculty of Environmental Science__](https://eng.vnua.edu.vn/). I have *3+ years* of experience building, and deploying machine learning & deep learning models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as Machine Learning Certification by [__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/), IBM Data Science Professional Certificate [__IBM__](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/data-science-professional-certificate), and Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/). These transformative courses have sculpted my theoretical understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Later, I began to work on projects ranging from the pharmaceutical, agricultural, retail, service, and real estate industries. 

I worked at companies such as [__INOGSI__](https://ignosi.global/), and [__Soils and Fertilizers Institute__](https://en.sfri.org.vn/) as a __Soil Scientist__ & __Data Scientist__. These professional experiences have been pivotal in harnessing the power of data to create tangible value.. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.üôÇ

## üìîüììMy InspirationüòÄüòÄ:

<img src = "https://github.com/ddthang86/Images/blob/main/GitHub%20Inspiration%20Image.jpg"/>

My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence began when I was in my final year of a Bachelor of Technology program. I suggested to my teammates that we work on a machine learning project in __healthcare__, specifically using it to predict the chances of a person suffering from heart disease. We were able to download a dataset from [__Kaggle__](https://www.kaggle.com/) and implement machine learning models to make predictions. 

The results of the test set were promising, and this sparked my interest in finding more ways to apply machine learning. I have since taken courses in machine learning, including Andrew Ng's __Machine Learning__ and __Deep Learning Specialization__, and have worked on various data science projects in healthcare, academia, and the retail industry. Some of these projects involved data analysis and visualization to gain insights.
